Task Plan
First Stage: six weeks
1. Start simple, generate victims randomly with precise distance and direction as waypoints, generate trajectory and control the drone according to previous assignments so that the drone can fly over each victim in turn. (two weeks)

2. Consider noisy sensor. While receiving the real time signal, use Kalman filter to calibrate and modify the trajectory in real time. (two weeks)

3. Consider more complex sensor model with restricted sensor range, generate trajectory in a local region and then fly towards next region. (two weeks)

Second Stage:
other improvement: rescue more serious victims, avoid obstacles, reconstruct the map, multiple drones, to be discussed.

Goal:
cover all the area and locate the victims fast; report the locations accurately

Task Assignment:
Dongyue, and Yuhang: sensor model
Yamo: control and possible mission planning
Xuhui and Yunfeng: trajectory generation: the path for global search and local search with waypoints, including the control of altitude for accuracy
